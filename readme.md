## Project Overview

This dissertation investigates the socio-spatial impacts of the 2010 Southwest China drought on rural land productivity and population migration in Guizhou Province.  
Using a spatial quasi-experimental design combining MODIS NDVI, CHIRPS/SPEI climate indices, and county-level demographic data, the study assesses how drought-induced agricultural stress may have driven rural out-migration at the county scale.

**Main research questions:**
1. Did the 2010 drought significantly reduce agricultural productivity in Guizhou?
2. Was there a corresponding increase in rural out-migration?
3. Were these effects spatially heterogeneous?

**Core methods:**  
- Event Study + Difference-in-Differences (DiD) panel regression  
- NDVI time series analysis (2008–2012)  
- Spatial heterogeneity assessment
